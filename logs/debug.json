While 1984 and Animal Farm are amongst the most popular classic novels in the English language, this new series of Orwell‚Äôs essays seeks to bring a wider selection of his writing on politics and literature to a new readership. In The Prevention of Literature, the third in the Orwell‚Äôs Essays series, Orwell considers the freedom of thought and expression. He discusses the effect of the ownership of the press on the accuracy of reports of events, and takes aim at political language, which ‚Äòconsists almost entirely of prefabricated phrases bolted together.‚Äô The Prevention of Literature is a stirring cry for freedom from censorship, which Orwell says must start with the writer themselves: ‚ÄòTo write in plain vigorous language one has to think fearlessly.‚Äô 'A writer who can ‚Äì and must ‚Äì be rediscovered with every age.' ‚Äî Irish Times\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781913724313'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '191372431X'}], 'categories': ['Philosophy'], 'language': 'en'}}, {'id': 'xOKQnQAACAAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'George Orwell (ELL).', 'publishedDate': '2009', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'OCLC:958683602'}], 'language': 'en'}}, {'id': '9GE4AAAAIAAJ', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'Orwell and the Politics of Despair', 'subtitle': 'A Critical Study of the Writings of George Orwell', 'authors': ['Alok Rai'], 'publishedDate': '1988', 'description': \"Drawing on a wide range of Orwell's writing Rai charts his progression from rebellion through reconciliation to despair.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0521397472'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780521397476'}], 'categories': ['Literary Criticism'], 'language': 'en'}}, {'id': 'H6ZyimTwP2MC', 'volumeInfo': {'title': 'Orwell and the Dispossessed', 'authors': ['George Orwell'], 'publishedDate': '2001-05-03', 'description': \"This volume brings together Orwell's powerful writings of his personal exepriences of poverty and life outside mainstream society.

Best known for his chilling dystopia Nineteen-Eighty Four and the disturbing parable of Animal Farm, Orwell also turned his attention to subjects as wide-ranging as life amidst abject poverty, the strictures of a religious upbringing, the perils of British imperialism, the loss of innocence and the disillusionment of middle age. He centered his works on the characters involved and his pen captured the hopes and struggles of ordinary people as they attempted to live their lives.
